				In June 2011 I was looking through my late father's World War II scrapbook. Dad had the presence of mind to keep photos, letters, post cards and other memorabilia from 1942-1946, the time he spent in the army air force. His scrapbook included photos of him, photos of his fellow aviators, aerial photos, photos of airplanes, photos of girlfriends, photos of places he billeted, newspaper clippings, and post cards. I decided then that I would design and make a T-shirt dedicated to the American airmen of World War II.  All the background photos and gallery photos on the Archives page come from his scrapbook.
