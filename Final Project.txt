Final Project
I know someone who has a dog walking business. Her business is doing very well and I’m not sure she really wants a web presence.  She picks up your dog, takes the dog out with other dogs for a romp in the woods for a few hours and then brings you dog home exhausted. During the day she tweets photos of the dogs at play, with some text describing the dog interplay. I’d like to do a project where a visitor to the site can view the most recent five tweets as well as a description of the service on the home page and to include a simple form to gather contact and dog information that is emailed to the site’s owner.
