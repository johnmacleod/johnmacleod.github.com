			<li><a href="cm.1/index.html"><h1>Camp Maisy</h1></a></li>
			<p>
			This is a prototype website for a local business. The Home and Tweets page work; the others do not. Used a responsive approach-you can view the site on your iPhone and iPad. The owner recently asked me to complete the site.
			</p>

			<li><a href="8/index.html"><h1>Groton Board of Trade</h1></a></li>
			<p>
			I made this prototype concept for the Groton Board of Trade, a business organization in my town.

			<li><a href="http://www.leedesign.biz/"><h1>Lee Design</h1></a></li>
			<p>
			Lee Design is a website for Boston-based surface designer, Marilyn MacLeod. Yes, we're related, she's my sister.
			</p>

			<li><a href="http://vintage-airplane.com"><h1>Vintage Airplane T-Shirts</h1></a></li>
			<p>
			My late father's WWII scrapbook told his story as an army air corps pilot. After browsing through his scrapbook, I felt compelled to design a T-Shirt using an image of one of planes he flew. Later I created this e-commerce website to sell the T-shirt.

			<li><a href="http://johnmacleod.github.com/5.6/index.html"><h1>Blackbird Cafe</h1></a></li>
			<p>
			This is a concept for a site of a local cafe I patronize. The home page and Coffee & Tea page are the only working pages.
			</p>

			<li><a href="http://leadershipsolutionsgrp.com/blog/"><h1>LSG</h1></a></li>
			<p>
			This is a Wordpress concept website for a Houston-based recruiter.
