		     <h2>Web Trends</h2>
		     <p>Website design and development is currently experiencing a renaissance. With new standards—HTML 5 and CSS 3 more can be done then ever before. We have come a long way since websites development used tables for layout. </p> 

		     <p>Responsive web design is a new concept in site development—well relatively new, Ethan Marcotte wrote about it in 2010, and he literally wrote the book on it. With a responsive approach your website’s content is recast in each device it is viewed in. The viewing of a responsive website is optimized for the different screen sizes. A smart phone arranges and displays the content appropriately; a tablet arranges and displays content appropriately and so on.</p>

		     <p>To better understand responsive design, use your cursor to grab the side of your browser. Expand and collapse the browser along the horizontal axis. Observe how the images and text move and change. The Boston Globe www.bostonglobe.com is a responsive site; </p>

         <p>the New York Times is not—unless you’re a subscriber.</p>

		     <p>Flat UI or Flat User Interface is a recent web framework. Flat UI purists adhere to not using any gradients or shadows on their user interface elements. Web designers fall into three Flat UI camps, they: love it, hate it or love it but still want to include gradients and shadows. Flat UI celebrates keeping two-dimensional images two-dimensional. Elements don’t rely on drop shadows or other embellishments to punch out an image to make it more realistic. Flat UI embodies simplicity.</p> 

		     <p>So, a recipe of responsive design with some Flat UI sprinkled in makes a website visually interesting, easy to navigate and pleasing to the eye. But, that’s not all. How we use and access the web is changing. More people are using their phones and tablets to read their email, get directions, check restaurant reviews, and buy stuff.</p>

        <p>If you need a web presence—big or small—I can build one for you.</p>

		     <h2>About</h2>
		     <p><img src="img/jdm4.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100 " align="left" class="myphoto">JJohn MacLeod started his design career as a draftsman, making detail drawings for an architect in New Hampshire. Previous to this he took courses in architecture at the Boston Architectural Center, BAC. John returned to school—Mass College of Art and Design—to continue studying architecture but switched concentration to industrial design. He received a BFA from Mass Art in industrial design.</p> 

		     <p>He worked for high technology companies for over twenty years—fourteen spent in software QA. His work in software made him appreciate software applications: how they’re conceived and how they’re implemented. He is obsessed and exited with the evolution of the web
         </p>

		     <p>With that in mind, he is saddened by the Bruins’ recent loss to Chicago in game six of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. “But,” John says, “we still have the Red Sox and there will be next year for the Bs.” </p>
