  <h3><b><br />
    WANTED</b></h3>
  <p>We're looking for <strong>vintage sports material</strong>. We'd prefer 16mm reels but will
    consider just about anything as long as the quality is acceptable.
    We're also still seeking any <strong>archival footage shot in and around
    Boston</strong>. 16mm, Standard8mm or Super8mm is OK. Finally, we're on the hunt
    for updated <strong>footage which features any and all aspects of current
    technology</strong>. Manufacturing, automation, computer technology or <strong>anything
    cutting edge</strong> would be great. </p>
  <h3><b>FOR SALE</b></h3>
  <p>A large collection of 8mm and Super 8mm films is for sale. If
    you're a collector of old 8mm films, you'll find some interesting and
    even rare items.  Please contact Mike Huard at 781-331-1424 or <a href="mailto:mike@huardvideo.com">mike@huardvideo.com</a> for inquiries about purchase. Please also visit his web site at  <a href="http://www.mikehuard.com/"> http://www.mikehuard.com</a>.</p>

      35mm sources but tape source is welcome, too. Give us a call at
