<h3><i>How Time Flies!</i></h3>
</center>
Thank you for visiting. It's hard to believe that we're approaching the
end of 2003. The year has just gone by too fast! So, we have to stop
and take a moment to thank all of our loyal customers who continue to
call on us for their stock footage needs. Our deepest thanks to all of
you. And if you're new to the world of stock footage, we hope you'll
give us the opportunity to help with your next project. As we approach
our 20th year in business, we remain one of the largest, privately
owned stock footage companies in the nation. Our contemporary
collection exceeds 10,000 hours and our vintage film collection has
grown to over 8,000 prints from the early 1900's to the 70's. <p>
 We acquire new material on a regular basis, so please call or fax if you don't see what you're looking for in our  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040806155315/http://members.aol.com/stockvideo/index.html"> Partial Stock Footage Subject Index. </a>

<b>QUICKTIME</b>: Clips are now available in a QuickTime format. For
those of you who are pressed for time, we can e-mail motion files or

one or two clips are needed. Feel free to call us with any questions.

<b>FOR SALE</b>: A large collection of 8mm and Super 8mm films. If
you're a collector of old 8mm films, you'll find some interesting and
even rare items. Visit our <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040806155315/http://members.aol.com/stockvideo/8mmindex.html"> 8MM AND SUPER 8 MM FILM TITLES INDEX.</a>  There are over <b>1100 titles</b>
to choose from ! Make an offer on one or all but please be patient when

thanks to all who have inquired so far. Please note that effective
immediately, we have created a mirror site which features a frequently
updated version of the 8mm database: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040806155315/http://www.mikehuard.com/"> www.mikehuard.com.</a>  Mike now personally handles all 8mm inquiries and sales.

consider just about anything as long as the quality is acceptable.

Boston. 16mm, Standard8mm or Super8mm is OK. FInally, we're on the hunt
for updated footage which features any and all aspects of current
